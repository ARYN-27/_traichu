> **traiÂ´chu,** _n_. A simple, semantic start page built with HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript.


This start page utilizes technologies such as [DuckDuckGo's favicon API](https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/duckduckgo.com.ico) and [inline SVGs](https://css-tricks.com/pretty-good-svg-icon-system/) to handle the images (with the exception of the traichu sprite).


The color palette is composed of contrast accessibile, [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) compliant colors listed in [Japanese Industrial Standards](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS%E6%85%A3%E7%94%A8%E8%89%B2%E5%90%8D). The font is [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) loaded via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).


It uses [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)'s search engine in an effort to increase privacy and anonymity.


All interactions are handled via JavaScript and CSS animations.
