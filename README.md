## _traichu

A simple, semantic start page built with HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript.

This start page utilizes [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)'s privacy-focused search, DuckDuckGo's Favico API and inline SVGs to handle the images (with the exception of the traichu sprite), flexbox, and an 8-point grid system to handle the layout, with all interactions being handled via JavaScript and CSS animation.

The font, [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata), by Raph Levien, is loaded via Google Fonts. The color palette is composed of contrast accessibile, [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) compliant colors listed in [Japanese Industrial Standards](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS%E6%85%A3%E7%94%A8%E8%89%B2%E5%90%8D).
